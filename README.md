# APPocalypse-
SpaceApp Challenge 2018

Brief description of APPocalypse project

An easy way to be prepared to any catastrophic event: create your personal check list, discover the Earth disaster, learn how to act in case of emergency.

We are a team of engineering students with the purpose of helping people to increase the knoweledge about natural disasters and emercency procedures. This can be possible using an App that exploit the satellite's data taken from Nasa archives and some videos to inform people. It also gives you a useful check list and some indications to be prepared in case of emercency.
What we have reached is an online simulation of the real App called Appocalypse, that shows the generic structure of the App and what we can mainly do using it.
As we have already said this is a simulation, so we collect the information necessary to build up the App but we haven't used all of it. We have the idea on how to use it in case we decide to develop a real Appocalypse.
Let's see some examples that show where we can use the information that we have collected in some sections of Appocalypse:
- In the Frequent Disaster section (in Home and Travel section) Appocalypse can use the data for statistical analisys to give the probability of a given natural disaster in selected place in the world.
- In the Globe section, after choosing the type of disaster, Appocalypse can show you a global map that marks the locations where the disaster has taken place. After clicking on an interested area Appocalypse can also show you images before and after the disaster.
